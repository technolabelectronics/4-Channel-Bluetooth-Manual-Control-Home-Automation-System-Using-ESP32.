# INTRODUCTION
In this article we are going to make android app control home-automation system using esp32 inbuilt bluetooth feature along with this we can also control our home-appliances through regular  switch buttons that we generally uses in our homes.
Our android application will communicate to the esp32 via bluetooth, hence no WIFI is required.
For making of this project I will use my newly design 4 Node SMT home-automation PCB.

App will directly communicate to the esp32 via bluetooth.

The only down side of this home-automation system is , it will only work in local range.

If you want to purchase this 4 node SMT home-automation PCB then connect me.

We can give  input to control our devices via Manual switch button. 

This PCB is compatible for all the smart speakers available in the market like Amazons Alexa , google home and Apples SIRI.
